  description: |
    Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation,
    written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.
    It was originally created for the new Python documentation, and it has excellent
    facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ is already supported
    as well, and it is planned to add special support for other languages as well.
